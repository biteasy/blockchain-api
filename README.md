# Introduction

The ***blockchain-api*** repository contains code samples which will help you to get started with the [Biteasy](https://www.biteasy.com) Blockchain Rest API.

# Samples

In the ***samples*** folder you will find various code samples implemented in different languages. Most of them have none or minimum requirements in order to run and they should all work without the need of an API key.

Please refer to the comments of each code sample source file for details about it's functionality.
